# ESLint Fixes Documentation

This document summarizes the changes made to fix ESLint errors and improve code quality in the HirePath application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Fast Refresh Errors in AuthContext.tsx

**Problem**: The `react-refresh/only-export-components` rule was failing because the AuthContext.tsx file was exporting both components and non-component code.

**Solution**:
- Created a separate file `src/contexts/auth-context.ts` to hold the AuthContext and AuthContextType definitions
- Moved the AuthProvider component to `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Updated all imports to use the correct file paths

### 2. Unexpected 'any' Types in Login.tsx and Signup.tsx

**Problem**: Both Login.tsx and Signup.tsx were using `error: any` in catch blocks, which violates the `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` rule.

**Solution**:
- Replaced `catch (error: any)` with `catch (error)`
- Added type guards to safely access error properties:
  ```typescript
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    setError(error.message || 'Failed to sign in');
  } else {
    setError('Failed to sign in');
  }
  ```

### 3. Unused Variables

**Problem**: Several files had unused imports and variables that were causing ESLint warnings.

**Solution**:
- Removed unused imports in AuthContext.tsx
- Fixed all other unused variable issues throughout the codebase

## Files Modified

1. `src/contexts/auth-context.ts` - New file containing context definitions
2. `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Updated to only export the AuthProvider component
3. `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Updated imports to use the new auth-context.ts file
4. `src/pages/Login.tsx` - Fixed error handling and removed unused variables
5. `src/pages/Signup.tsx` - Fixed error handling and removed unused variables
6. `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Updated import path for useAuth hook
7. `src/components/Navbar.tsx` - Updated import path for useAuth hook

## Verification

- All ESLint errors have been resolved
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Application builds successfully
- Development server runs without issues

## Future Improvements

Consider adding Prettier to the project for consistent code formatting.
